Odometry model with rotating camera is adopted.

ALMcl.h: header file
ALMcl.cpp: sourse file 


A robot obtain a sensory input (vision data)
which contains several landmarks.
Each landmark is represented by v_i =(r_i, \theta_i)
drovector v_i (vision)

view is a dgematrix which contains several vision data.

the most accurately predicted vision contained in view
is used to updated particles.


drovector pos
is estimated position data.
pos = (p_x,p_y,p_\theta,p_\phi)

p_\theta   .... direction of body (right hand system)
p_\phi   ... angle between body and head
